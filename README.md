This is my first ever clone of a real time used application UltraEdit.

Ultraedit: A powerful and highly configurable text and hex editor with unrivaled support for large files.

To run the app on your site extract the files into a folder (NOTE: The html and css file should be in same folder else define the path of css file in the html file).

You can now open the html file in any browser.


Note: the downloaded links are correct only for english language with both 32-bit and 64-bit, for other languages are duplicated.
Note: the images might unable to load as I have used the direct links to the image urls.
